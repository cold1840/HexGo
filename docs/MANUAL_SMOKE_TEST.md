# Local Game Manual Smoke Test

Run `cargo run`, then complete this checklist before submitting a change that affects the local game UI.

## Launch and Layout

1. Confirm that the compact hexagonal grid appears on the left and the status panel appears on the right.
2. Confirm that all board edges are visible and connected, without duplicate or missing line segments.
3. Resize the window to its minimum dimensions and back. The board must remain centered, proportional, and fully visible.
4. Confirm that Simplified Chinese labels render legibly. The application searches for Source Han Sans, Noto Sans CJK, WenQuanYi Zen Hei, Microsoft YaHei, or PingFang and logs an English warning before falling back to Bevy's default font.

## Pointer Play

1. Hover over several empty intersections. A translucent stone matching the current player must follow the nearest intersection.
2. Click an empty intersection. A stone must appear, the current player must change, and the last move must receive an orange marker.
3. Click the occupied intersection. The board and current player must remain unchanged, and the panel must show an occupied-point error.
4. Play a short capture sequence. Captured stones must disappear immediately after the engine accepts the move.
5. Attempt suicide and positional-superko moves when suitable positions are available. Each rejected move must leave the board and turn unchanged and show the matching error.

## Keyboard Play

1. Press `Tab` until the board is focused. Move through intersections with all four arrow keys and place a stone with `Enter` or `Space`.
2. Use `Tab` and `Shift+Tab` to visit Pass, Resign, and Restart. The focused action must have a visible accent border.
3. Activate each action using only the keyboard. Press `Escape` in a confirmation dialog and confirm that no state changes.

## Completion and Restart

1. Select Pass once. The pass count must become `1 / 2` and the player must change.
2. Place a stone. The pass count must return to `0 / 2`.
3. Pass twice consecutively. Further play must be disabled and the result panel must show the winner, margin, stones, territory, komi, and totals.
4. Restart, cancel the dialog, and confirm the position remains. Restart again and confirm; the empty board, Black turn, and zero pass count must return.
5. Start another game, choose Resign, cancel once, then confirm. The result must name the opponent as the winner without showing a scored result.
